# NYC_Housing
NYC housing data wrangling, predictions, and visualizations

This Project's purpose is to formulate a machine learning model with reasonable predictive power in explaining real estate pricing in NYC.
I start by marrying neighborhood and demographic data to property sales data. From there, I start to clean and visualize the data before any modelling is done. 

Once the data is prepped, cleaned, and summarized in visualizations, I begin modelling using SciKit Learn. Python files are included in the Repo and some of the Tableau Visualizations are shown here.
